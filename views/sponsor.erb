      <h2 class="no-margin-top">What?</h2>
      <p class="sponsor__info">The 5C Hackathon is a semiannual hackathon held on Pomona College's campus. Last semester, over 300 of the Claremont Colleges' brightest techincal minds spent 12 hours hacking on projects ranging from 8trhacker, a Chrome extension to bypass limits on 8tracks, to GitBattle, an app to battle Github accounts.</p>
      <p class="sponsor__info">An entirely student-run event, the 5C Hackathon has rapidly become a highly anticipated and attended tradition at the Claremont Colleges, drawing talent from five different schools: Pomona, Harvey Mudd, Claremont McKenna, Scripps, and Pitzer.</p>
      <h2 class="no-margin-top">Why?</h2>
      <p class="sponsor__info">Sponsoring the 5C Hackathon is a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most talented tech and design undergraduates in the country. Participants comprise some of the most creative, motivated students at the Claremont Colleges, with skills ranging from graphic design, to mobile development, to game development. As a sponsor, you will be able to reach computer science, economics, and other majors who represent the student population that is most passionate about technology. And, unlike more traditional technical institutes, the Claremont Colleges graduate liberal arts students -- young people equipped with a set of skills that uniquely prepares them for any job, whether it's a role as a founder, first employee, or leader in a well-established company.</p>
